## 2. Database Setup
1. Create an Oracle schema (e.g., `electronic_store`).  
2. Run the provided SQL scripts (if available) to generate tables.  
3. Update `application.properties` with your Oracle connection:  
.properties
# Oracle Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

# JPA / Hibernate Settings
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle12cDialect

3. Build the Project
Open terminal in the project folder and run:
mvn clean install

4.To Run the Application
  1.Right clcik on project 
  2.select Run As Run on Server
  3.choose Apache Tomact11

->Security: Implemented authentication and session management to secure both customer and admin actions.
->Validation: Used frontend validation (Thymeleaf + JavaScript) and backend validation (Spring Validation) to ensure data integrity.
->Database Design: Designed relational tables in Oracle (Customers, Products, Orders, CartItems, Admin) with proper foreign key relationships for referential integrity.
->Testing: Added JUnit test cases for service and repository layers to ensure data consistency.
->Deployment: Built with Maven and deployed as a WAR file on Apache Tomcat.
